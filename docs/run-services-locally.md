# How to run the BE services locally

To run the backend services locally, you'll need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

First, download the [Offer Service Architecture](https://source.tui/dx/offer/content/offer-factory-infrastructure) repository. This repo contains all the microservices used by Nova.

Follow the [instructions](https://source.tui/dx/offer/content/offer-factory-infrastructure/-/blob/master/README.md) present on that repository to run the desired services.

> Remember to update the config (`nuxt.config.ts`) to change the base URL of the service that you are running locally
